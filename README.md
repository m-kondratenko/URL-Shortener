2. Application should remove origin-short url pair from DB on the 15th day after its creation.

Notes

This application uses the following technologies: 
- HTML, CSS for main blocks and styling;
- javaScript, Ajax for communicating with server without reloading of the page;
- PHP for main server logic;
- Silex framework for easier rooting.

When main page is first loaded, HTML will be given to user whereas verification of 15 days URLs expiring will be performed on server side.
Then user inserts his/her URL and can insert desired URL. After pressing the button, inserted data is sent to the server via ajax request. The data is passing through a few steps: 
- URL is checked if it is real by sending http request;
- URL and desired URL are modified to prevent html/sql injections;
- desired URL is checked if it is already presents in the DB;
- if desired URL was inserted, it is written to the DB;
- if desired URL was not inserted, short url is generated as a random set of predefined chars with random length (maximum length is also predifined);
- short url is given to the user.

When user uses short url, this url is also passed through similar steps. As a result, page is redirected to initial URL, which was stored in the DB. Usage counter is incremented.

Table "urls" consists of these fields: id, longurl, shorturl, date, usage.

In configuration.php you may change DB parameters, allowed chars for short URL generator, maximum length of short URL.
To turn logging off you need to change this string "php_value log_errors On" in .htaccess to this one "php_value log_errors Off".

To use API in your code you should try $shorturl=file_get_contents('http://DOMAIN/php/getshorturl.php?longurl='.urlencode('URL')); where "DOMAIN" is a domain of this URL shortener and "URL" is your URL to shorten.
